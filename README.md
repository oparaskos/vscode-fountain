This is a Language Server extension for [fountain](https://fountain.io/) files.

**Fountain** is a simple markup syntax for writing, editing and sharing screenplays in plain, human-readable text. Fountain allows you to work on your screenplay anywhere, on any computer or tablet, using any software that edits text files.

## Thanks / Third-party licenses

* Syntax highlighting thanks to a modified version of the .tmlanguage for [fountain-sublime-text](https://github.com/poritsky/fountain-sublime-text) by [Jonathan Poritsky](https://github.com/poritsky) (modified by [Piers Deseilligny](https://github.com/piersdeseilligny) for [betterfountain](https://github.com/piersdeseilligny/betterfountain))

* The statistics panel uses [d3](https://d3js.org/), covered by the [BSD-3-Clause License](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/LICENSE).

* The project was built using Microsoft's language server example extension as a boilerplate.
