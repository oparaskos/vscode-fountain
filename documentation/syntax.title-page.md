The optional Title Page is always the first thing in a Fountain document. Information is encoding in the format key: value. Keys can have spaces (e. g. Draft date), but must end with a colon.

```fountain

The key values may change, but those listed above comprise a minimal useful set. If you add unsupported key values to your document, they will be ignored, but you may find them useful as metadata.

All Title Page parts are optional.

A page break is implicit after the Title Page. Just drop down two lines and start writing your screenplay.
