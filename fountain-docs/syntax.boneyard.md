If you want Fountain to ignore some text, wrap it with `/* some text */`. In this example, an entire scene is put in the boneyard. It will be ignored completely on formatted output.

```fountain
COGNITO
Everyoneâ€™s coming after you mate! Scorpio, The Boy Band, Sparrow, Point Blank Sniperâ€¦

As he rattles off the long list, Brick and Steel share a look. This is going to be BAD.

CUT TO:
/*
INT. GARAGE - DAY

BRICK and STEEL get into Momâ€™s PORSCHE, Steel at the wheel. They pause for a beat, the gravity of the situation catching up with them.

BRICK
This is everybody weâ€™ve ever put away.

STEEL
(starting the engine)
So much for retirement!

They speed off. To destiny!

CUT TO:
*/
EXT. PALATIAL MANSION - DAY

An EXTREMELY HANDSOME MAN drinks a beer. Shirtless, unfortunately.

The boneyard is the exception to the rule of syntax not carrying across line breaks. Your /* â€¦ */ pairs can span as much of your screenplay as you like.
