# Sections

Sections are optional markers for managing the structure of a story. Some screenplay applications use these like nested folders in a navigation view.

Fountainâ€™s Sections resemble Markdownâ€™s ATX-style headers, but differ in that they do not appear in formatted output.

Create a Section by preceding a line with one or more pound-sign `#` characters:
```fountain
CUT TO:

# This is a Section

INT. PALACE HALLWAY - NIGHT
```

You can nest Sections by adding more # characters.

```fountain
# Act

## Sequence

### Scene

## Another Sequence

# Another Act
```
