# Scene Heading

[ðŸ“• Read More at fountain.io](https://fountain.io/syntax#section-slug)

**Power User**: You can "force" a Scene Heading by starting the line with a single period.

A line beginning with any of the following, followed by either a dot or a space, is considered a Scene Heading (unless the line is preceded by an exclamation point !). Case insensitive.

```
	INT
	EXT
	EST
	INT./EXT
	INT/EXT
	I/E
```

**Power User**: Scene Headings can optionally be appended with Scene Numbers. Scene numbers are any alphanumerics (plus dashes and periods), wrapped in #. All of the following are valid scene numbers:

```fountain
	INT. HOUSE - DAY #1#

	INT. HOUSE - DAY #1A#
	
	INT. HOUSE - DAY #1a#
	
	INT. HOUSE - DAY #A1#
	
	INT. HOUSE - DAY #I-1-A#
	
	INT. HOUSE - DAY #1.#
	
	INT. HOUSE - DAY - FLASHBACK (1944) #110A#

```
