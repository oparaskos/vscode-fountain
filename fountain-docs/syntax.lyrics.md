You create a Lyric by starting with a line with a tilde ~.

```fountain
~Willy Wonka! Willy Wonka! The amazing chocolatier!
~Willy Wonka! Willy Wonka! Everybody give a cheer!
```

Fountain will remove the ‘~’ and leave it up to the app to style the Lyric appropriately. Lyrics are always forced. There is no “automatic” way to get them.
