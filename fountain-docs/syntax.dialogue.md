Dialogue is any text following a Character or Parenthetical element.

	SANBORN
	A good 'ole boy. You know, loves the Army, blood runs green. Country boy. Seems solid.

## Characters

A Character element is any line entirely in uppercase, with one empty line before it and without an empty line after it.

	STEEL
	The man's a myth!

"Character Extensions"--the parenthetical notations that follow a character name on the same line--may be in uppercase or lowercase:

	MOM (O. S.)
	Luke! Come down for supper!

**Power User**: You can force a Character element by preceding it with the "at" symbol @.

*Character names must include at least one alphabetical character. "R2D2" works, but "23" does not.*

The ability to force a Character element is helpful for names that require lower-case letters, and for non-Roman languages.

	@McCLANE
	Yippie ki-yay! I got my lower-case C back!

## Parenthetical

	Parentheticals follow a Character or Dialogue element, and are wrapped in parentheses ().

	STEEL
	(starting the engine)
	So much for retirement!

## Dual Dialogue

	Dual, or simultaneous, dialogue is expressed by adding a caret ^ after the second Character element.

	BRICK
	Screw retirement.

	STEEL ^
	Screw retirement.

	Any number of spaces between the Character name and the caret are acceptable, and will be ignored. All that matters is that the caret is the last character on the line.
