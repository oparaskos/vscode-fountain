# Transition

[ðŸ“• Read More at fountain.io](https://fountain.io/syntax#section-trans)

The requirements for Transition elements are:

1. Uppercase
2. Preceded by and followed by an empty line
3. Ending in `TO:`

*Example:*

```fountain
Jack begins to argue vociferously in Vietnamese (?), But mercifully we...

CUT TO:

EXT. BRICK'S POOL - DAY
```

**Power user**: You can force any line to be a transition by beginning it with a greater-than symbol >.

```fountain
Brick and Steel regard one another.  A job well done.

> Burn to White.
```

**Power user**: If a line matches the rules for Transition, but you want in interpreted as something else, you have two options:
1. Precede it with a period to force a Scene Heading, or
2. Add one or more spaces after the colon to cause the line to be interpreted as Action (since the line no longer ends with a colon).
