Synopses are optional blocks of text to describe a Section or scene.

Synopses are single lines prefixed by an equals sign =. They can be located anywhere within the screenplay.

```fountain
# ACT I

= Set up the characters and the story.

EXT. BRICKâ€™S PATIO - DAY

= This scene sets up Brick & Steelâ€™s new life as retirees. Warm sun, cold beer, and absolutely nothing to do.

A gorgeous day. The sun is shining. But BRICK BRADDOCK, retired police detective, is sitting quietly, contemplating -- something.

Like Sections, Synopses are purely optional tools for the writerâ€™s outlining and organizational process. They are ignored in formatted output.
